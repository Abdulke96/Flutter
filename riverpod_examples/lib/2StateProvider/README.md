# Riverpod Counter App
A simple counter app built using Riverpod for state management in Flutter.

# Overview
This Flutter application demonstrates the use of Riverpod, a powerful state management library, to create a simple counter app. It utilizes both Provider for immutable state and StateProvider for mutable state.

# Riverpod Providers
titleProvider (Immutable State)
Description: A provider for the title of the app.
Type: Provider<String>
Initial Value: "Counter App"
countProvider (Mutable State)
Description: A state provider to manage the counter value.
Type: StateProvider<int>
Initial Value: 0
How It Works
The app displays the counter value and provides buttons to increment, decrement, or reset the counter.
